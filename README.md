#SLAM using ROS packages

contact: @gersononail@hotmail.com

This is part of the project I'm doing in order to do autonomous navigation using SLAM through ROS. At the moment, I've managed to make mapping from a plannar indoors environment. 

While I'm studying the implementation of ROS packages, I'll be modificating some files and adding related content.

So far, this is only for open source content and sharing, so feel yourselft free to use this for whatever you want.
